# Natural-Language-Processing-with-TensorFlow-2
I did this "freeCodeCamp.org" on youtube and these are the codes I wrote while doing the course. Each notebook is a project and the 3 preojects are,  

1. Getting Started with Word Embeddings:
     
        This tutorial contains an introduction to word embeddings. You will train your own word embeddings using a simple Keras model for a sentiment classification           task, and then visualize them in the Embedding Projector.     


2. Performing sentiment analysis on movie reviews and text classification using an RNN: 

        This text classification tutorial trains a recurrent neural network on the IMDB large movie review dataset for sentiment analysis.
    
    
3. After reading a "Shakespear" snippet, The model generates similar styled text using an RNN:
      
        This tutorial demonstrates how to generate text using a character-based RNN. You will work with a dataset of Shakespeare's writing from Andrej Karpathy's The           Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks. Given a sequence of characters from this data ("Shakespear"), train a model to predict the next               character in the sequence ("e"). Longer sequences of text can be generated by calling the model repeatedly.
